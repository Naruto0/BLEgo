# BLEgo
BLEgo changes defalut .obj materials to cycle nodes with some glossiness and makes transparent bricks a glass.

#### Be sure all other materials in scene start with "_"!!!

## Few easy steps to make it work

* Export desired lego MOC from **LeoCAD** as wavefront .obj (or use my MOC)
* Import .obj to Blender (in my tutorial project with *clamp size* 10 blender units, -Y as *forward* and Z as *Up axis*)
* open **BLEgo.py** script and run with **alt+P**

#### Please review the code and send a feedback, or commit and suggest better code!
