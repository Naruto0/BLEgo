# BLEgo
BLEgo changes defalut .obj materials to cycle nodes with some glossines and makes transparent bricks a glass.

Be sure all aother materials in scene begin with "_"!!!

## Few easy steps

* Export desired lego MOC from LEO CAD as wavefront .obj
* Import .obj to Blender (in my tutorial project with *clamp size* 10 blender units, -Y as *forward* and Z as *Up axis*)
* open BLEgo.py script and run with **alt+P**
